\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}

\subsubsection{Volatility}

Volatility in financial markets (huge discussion on volatility, why it happens, why prices doesn't behave around the mean as expected etc)...	

\subsubsection{Foreign Exchange}

In the past 30 years the foreign exchange markets has grown from an exclusive, locked down market to one of the most actively traded and liquid markets today. The market has many interesting properties compared to the more historically significant stock market, such as 24 hour trading, and the price being a good general reflection on the state of a country or unions economy. However, due to the recent surge in interest in this market it has not had the same level of study as the traditionally popular markets despite showing some interesting behaviours that may be of interest...

\subsubsection{Fuzzy Logic}

Some of the greatest difficulties with detecting certain patterns in technical analysis is determining whether a price is a valid part of a pattern when it is 'kind of' part of a pattern and 'kind of' not. Studies on technical analysis often define crisp ranges to group together prices, such as in \citep{foundations} where prices are seen to be equal in a pattern if they are within 1.5\% of their averages. This of course leaves us with the issue that prices within 1.49\% are observered as being part of a pattern but prices within 1.51\% are discarded in the same manner as a price that differs dramatically...

\subsection{Objectives}

\subsubsection{Benefits of Fuzzy Pattern Matching}

Fuzzy logic is still a new field of interest but with a wide range of applications. There is still much room for research that demonstrates the differences in performance between using a fuzzy logic system and using a traditional crisp logic system... (Need to actually do both then!)

\subsubsection{Applying Stock Market Analysis to Foreign Exchange Markets}

The methods described in this paper have been shown to be effective at predicting the price movement of companies on the Stock Exchange. There appears to be significant differences in the behaviour of the foreign exchange market and the Stock exchange, as told by ...

\subsubsection{Predictive Capability of Technical Analysis}

There is still much debate as to whether analysis of previous price action can be used to determine future price performance...

\subsubsection{Using Statistical Techniques to Analyse Price Movement}

I'm not sure where to throw this in, but it's important. This is essentially the only way the method my dissertation differs to previous work, so I need to justify it. (ie. I'm grouping the price using z-scores)...

\subsection{Technical Analysis}

Technical Analysis is a form of financial analysis where past price behaviour is used to predict future price behaviour in financial markets. Proponents of this system claim that the movement of price, or change in some other factor such as volume, can be subject to recurring patterns, which can be used to predict future changes in price. Examples of this form of analysis include identifying trends in a graph of price movement, or concluding that a price is unlikely to go lower than the 52-week low.

\subsubsection{History}

The use of this form of analysis has been documented for several hundred years. One of the first uses of Technical Analysis dates back to Japan in the 18th Century AD. In 1710 Japan's rice market had matured enough to begin use rice coupons instead of trading physical rice. Their receipts were traded constituting the first Futures trades ever recorded \citep[p.15]{jcct1991}. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell assets at a fixed price, but to be delivered or paid for in the future. 

Munehisa Homma was a rice merchant in Japan, who is sometimes credited as the Father of Japanese Candlestick Analysis. Although it is debated whether Homma actually used modern Technical Analysis or charting techniques, it is recorded that he used the history of price movement to gauge the emotions of the market at the time, ``When all are bearish, there is cause for prices to rise. When everyone is bullish, there is cause for the price to fall''. Following Homma different charting techniques were introduced, until the introduction and popularisation of Japanese Candlestick Charting for Technical Analysis in the mid 19th Century \citep{jcct1994}.

In the west, Dow Theory was developed and expanded on in the early 20th Century, leading to works \citep{edwards2012technical} that directly influence Technical Analysis today.

\subsubsection{Efficient Market Hypothesis}

Even with such a diverse history the use of Technical Analysis is still a hotly debated topic. Experts are divided in their use of Technical Analysis \citep{foundations}, and although some claim that a majority of analysts incorporate Technical Analysis, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this claim. Furthermore it is unclear which particular techniques are in use, with proponents sometimes offering dramatically different opinions as to the effectiveness of different techniques.

One explanation is that Technical Analysis appears to contradict the once widely accepted Efficient Market Hypothesis. The Efficient Market Hypothesis claims that the price of a security is extremely efficient at reflecting the information about that security. When news becomes public the market will very efficiently arrive at a price for the security that reflects the impact of the news. This claim has major consequences, such that both Technical Analysis and Fundamental Analysis, which is analysing the health of a security by viewing information such as company earnings, are unable to help an investor achieve a greater profit than if a random selection of securities were invested in \citep{emhAndCritics}. 

While there is still a lot of support for this model, strict adherence to it does not offer the complete picture. If the markets were perfectly efficient then the price would simply jump between points as individual news was released. In reality there is a large amount of noise, volatility and uncertainty in the market. Very often it is not clear what impact some news should have. And of course the accuracy of market information and the availability of the information to the public add further uncertainty to the price movement.

The Random Walk Hypothesis says that even with these movements in price the market is still informationally efficient. It proposes that the price of a security represents a 'random walk' around its intrinsic value, and consequently that price movements can not be predicted. \cite{lo1988} reject this hypothesis however, but note that ``this rejection does not necessarily imply the inefficiency of stock-price formulation''.

One theory is that these discrepancy's are what allow Technical Analysis to be utilised. \cite{indefenseof} show that past prices combined with other information can achieve unusual profit. They claim that non-price information creates opportunity that can be efficiently exploited using Technical Analysis. 

With this difference in opinion in the professional world there has been much academic interest in the topic.

Research into whether Technical Analysis comes down to market psychology, cognitive biases or is a genuine market phenomena are yet to be concluded. efficient markets hypothesis

\subsubsection{Scientific Credibility}

Another explanation for this disagreement is the view that Technical Analysis lacks some of the scientific rigour applied to other techniques in common use. This is partly due to the difficulty in experimentally verifying some Technical Analysis techniques, many of which rely on visual pattern recognition in the eyes on an Expert. This subjectivity as to the existence of a pattern can sometimes lead to experts viewing differently or disagreeing about certain patterns, fuelling the controversy that Technical Analysis is nothing more than pseudo-analysis.

These difficulties in verifying different techniques scientifically have been countered in recent years with...
